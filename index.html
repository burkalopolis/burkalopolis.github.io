		<h1> What is your Civic Duty?</h1>
		<h3>Help others by Healing Yourself</h3>
		<p> Where trauma has occurred, and goes unaddressed, those experiences block the alignment of our body, mind, and spirit causing our behaviors to range unbalancing our equilibrium. The result of energy blocks can be destructive not only to ourselves, but others as well. As a community, we rely on each other to manage individual health and wellness for our shared existence to be harmonious. 
				<br>
				<br>
		The road to recovery incurs out of pocket expenses, a commitment to changing behavior, or proactively advocating for oneself. Instead of deferring to future you, start today!
		Civic Duty curates wellness data for individuals and populations through a free two-minute daily self-reporting tool. In today's age of technology, we are long overdue for a free to use platform for the day to day recordkeeping of holistic wellness to make informed decisions. This information benefits individuals to intervene and self-regulate as appropriate, but also community end-users of data. <br>
		<br>As a social enterprise, Civic Duty imagines an open market for wellness data between the User and the Community Service provider generating population metrics for wellness and resilience over time. We wholeheartedly believe, collecting this information is the first step to advancing society's road to recovery facing systematic injustices and inequities. <br>
		<br>The measures used for holistic wellness are globally recognized as the eight dimensions of wellness including: <br>

		<br> We are actively seeking interested users for the pilot of the Civic Duty application prototype being designed and built by the California State University of Sacramento Software Development Senior Project Student Team of eight persons known as HTMLephant. The pilot will involve trending the wellness data for individuals and populations to make more informed decisions. Civic Duty connects individuals to their communities, incorporating activity specific impacts to holistic wellness. Userâ€™s own their data and may subscribe to share relevant data to select communities in exchange for user incentives including but not limited too free hosting of user wellness data. <br>
